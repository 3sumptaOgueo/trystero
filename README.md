# üìØ Trystero

**Serverless WebRTC matchmaking for painless P2P: make any site multiplayer in a
few lines**

üëâ **[TRY THE DEMO](https://oxism.com/trystero)** üëà

Trystero manages a clandestine courier network that lets your application's
users talk directly with one another, encrypted and without a server middleman.

Peers can connect via [BitTorrent, Firebase, or IPFS](#strategy-comparison) ‚Äì
all using the same API.

## How it works

üëâ **If you just want to try out Trystero, you can skip this explainer and
[jump into using it](#get-started).**

To establish a direct peer-to-peer connection with WebRTC, a signalling channel
is needed to exchange peer information
([SDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol)). Typically
this involves running your own matchmaking server but Trystero abstracts this
away for you and offers multiple "serverless" strategies for connecting peers
(currently BitTorrent, Firebase, and IPFS).

The important point to remember is this:

> üîí
>
> Beyond peer discovery, your app's data never touches the strategy medium and
> is sent directly peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted between users.
>
> üëÜ

You can [compare strategies here](#strategy-comparison).

## Get started

You can install with npm (`npm i trystero`) and import like so:

```javascript
import {joinRoom} from 'trystero'
```

Or maybe you prefer a simple script tag?

```html
<script type="module">
  import {joinRoom} from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/trystero'
</script>
```

By default, the [BitTorrent strategy](#strategy-comparison) is used. To use a
different one just deep import like so (your bundler should handle including
only relevant code):

```javascript
import {joinRoom} from 'trystero/firebase'
// or
import {joinRoom} from 'trystero/ipfs'
```

Next, join the user to a room with a namespace:

```javascript
const config = {appId: 'san_narciso_3d'}
const room = joinRoom(config, 'yoyodyne')
```

The first argument is a configuration object that requires an `appId`. This
should be a completely unique identifier for your app (for the BitTorrent and
IPFS strategies) or your Firebase database ID if you're using Firebase. The
second argument is the room name.

> Why rooms? Browsers can only handle a limited amount of WebRTC connections at
> a time so it's recommended to design your app such that users are divided into
> groups (or rooms, or namespaces, or channels... whatever you'd like to call
> them).

## Listen for events

Listen for peers joining the room:

```javascript
room.onPeerJoin(id => console.log(`${id} joined`))
```

Listen for peers leaving the room:

```javascript
room.onPeerLeave(id => console.log(`${id} left`))
```

Listen for peers sending their audio/video streams:

```javascript
room.onPeerStream((stream, id) => (peerElements[id].video.srcObject = stream))
```

To unsubscribe from events, leave the room:

```javascript
room.leave()
```

## Broadcast events

Send peers your video stream:

```javascript
room.addStream(
  await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({audio: true, video: true})
)
```

Send and subscribe to custom P2P actions:

```javascript
const [sendDrink, getDrink] = room.makeAction('drink')

// buy drink for a friend
sendDrink({drink: 'negroni', withIce: true}, friendId)

// buy round for the house (second argument omitted)
sendDrink({drink: 'mezcal', withIce: false})

// listen for drinks sent to you
getDrink((data, id) =>
  console.log(
    `got a ${data.drink} with${data.withIce ? '' : 'out'} ice from ${id}`
  )
)
```

You can also use actions to send binary data, like images:

```javascript
const [sendPic, getPic] = room.makeAction('pic')

// blobs are automatically handled, as are any form of TypedArray
canvas.toBlob(blob => sendPic(blob))

// binary data is received as raw ArrayBuffers so your handling code should
// interpret it in a way that makes sense
getPic((data, id) => (imgs[id].src = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([data]))))
```

Let's say we want users to be able to name themselves:

```javascript
const idsToNames = {}
const [sendName, getName] = room.makeAction('name')

// tell other peers currently in the room our name
sendName('Oedipa')

// tell newcomers
room.onPeerJoin(id => sendName('Oedipa', id))

// listen for peers naming themselves
getName((name, id) => (idsToNames[id] = name))

room.onPeerLeave(id =>
  console.log(`${idsToNames[id] || 'a weird stranger'} left`)
)
```

> Actions are smart and handle serialization and chunking for you behind the
> scenes. This means you can send very large files and whatever data you send
> will be received on the other side as the same type (a number as a number,
> a string as a string, an object as an object, binary as binary, etc.).

## Advanced

### Binary metadata

Let's say your app supports sending various types of files and you want to
annotate the raw bytes being sent with metadata about how they should be
interpreted. Instead of manually adding metadata bytes to the buffer you can
simply pass a metadata argument in the sender action for your binary payload:

```javascript
const [sendFile, getFile] = makeAction('file')

getFile((data, id, meta) =>
  console.log(
    `got a file (${meta.name}) from ${id} with type ${meta.type}`,
    data
  )
)

// to send metadata, pass a third argument
// to broadcast to the whole room, set the second peer ID argument to null
sendFile(buffer, null, {name: 'The Courier ºs Tragedy', type: 'application/pdf'})
```

### Action promises

Action sender functions return a promise that resolves when they're done
sending. You can optionally use this to indicate to the user when a large
transfer is done.

```javascript
await sendFile(amplePayload)
console.log('done sending')
```

### Encryption

Once peers are connected to each other all of their communications are
end-to-end encrypted. During the initial connection / discovery process, peers'
[SDPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Description_Protocol) are sent via
the chosen peering strategy medium. The SDP is encrypted over the wire, but is
visible in plaintext as it passes through the medium (a public torrent tracker
for example). This is fine for most use cases but isn't always ideal as the SDP
contains the peer's IP address. Trystero provides an option for encrypting the
SDP so it isn't readable by the operator of the peering medium. To opt into
SDP encryption just pass a `password` parameter, e.g.:

```javascript
joinRoom({appId: 'kinneret', password: 'MuchoMaa$'}, 'w_a_s_t_e__v_i_p')
```

Keep in mind the password has to match for all peers in the room for them to be
able to connect. An example use case might be a private chat room where users
learn the password via external means.

## API

### `joinRoom(config, namespace)`

Adds local user to room whereby other peers in the same namespace will open
communication channels and send events.

- `config` - Configuration object containing the following keys:

  - `appId` - **(required)** A unique string identifying your app. If using
    Firebase this should be the database ID (also see `firebaseApp` below for
    an alternative way of configuring the Firebase strategy).

  - `password` - **(optional)** A string to encrypt session descriptions as they
    are passed through the peering medium. If set, session descriptions will be
    encrypted using AES-CBC. The password must match between any peers in the
    namespace for them to connect. See [encryption](#encryption) for more
    details.

  - `rtcConfig` - **(optional)** Specifies a custom
    [`RTCConfiguration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCConfiguration)
    for all peer connections.

  - `trackerUrls` - **(optional, üåä BitTorrent only)** Custom list of torrent
    tracker URLs to use. They must support WebSocket connections.

  - `trackerRedundancy` - **(optional, üåä BitTorrent only)** Integer specifying
    how many torrent trackers to connect to simultaneously in case some fail.
    Defaults to 2, maximum of 3. Passing a `trackerUrls` option will cause this
    option to be ignored as the entire list will be used.

  - `firebaseApp` - **(optional, üî• Firebase only)** You can pass an already
    initialized Firebase app instance instead of an `appId`. Normally Trystero
    will initialize a Firebase app based on the `appId` but this will fail if
    you ºve already initialized it for use elsewhere.

  - `rootPath` - **(optional, üî• Firebase only)** String specifying path where
    Trystero writes its matchmaking data in your database (`'__trystero__'` by
    default). Changing this is useful if you want to run multiple apps using the
    same database and don't want to worry about namespace collisions.

  - `swarmAddresses` - **(optional, ü™ê IPFS only)** List of IPFS multiaddrs to
    be passed to `config.Addresses.Swarm`.

- `namespace` - A string to namespace peers and events within a room.

Returns an object with the following methods:

- ### `leave()`

  Remove local user from room and unsubscribe from room events.

- ### `getPeers()`

  Returns a list of peer IDs present in room (not including the local user).

- ### `addStream(stream, [peerId], [metadata])`

  Broadcasts media stream to other peers.

  - `stream` - A `MediaStream` with audio and/or video to send to peers in the
    room.

  - `peerId` - **(optional)** If specified, the stream is sent only to the
    target peer ID (string) or list of peer IDs (array).

  - `metadata` - **(optional)** Additional metadata (any serializable type) to
    be sent with the stream. This is useful when sending multiple streams so
    recipients know which is which (e.g. a webcam versus a screen capture). If
    you want to broadcast a stream to all peers in the room with a metadata
    argument, pass `null` as the second argument.

- ### `removeStream(stream, [peerId])`

  Stops sending previously sent media stream to other peers.

  - `stream` - A previously sent `MediaStream` to stop sending.

  - `peerId` - **(optional)** If specified, the stream is removed only from the
    target peer ID (string) or list of peer IDs (array).

- ### `addTrack(track, stream, [peerId], [metadata])`

  Adds a new media track to a stream.

  - `track` - A `MediaStreamTrack` to add to an existing stream.

  - `stream` - The target `MediaStream` to attach the new track to.

  - `peerId` - **(optional)** If specified, the track is sent only to the
    target peer ID (string) or list of peer IDs (array).

  - `metadata` - **(optional)** Additional metadata (any serializable type) to
    be sent with the track. See `metadata` notes for `addStream()` above for
    more details.

- ### `removeTrack(track, stream, [peerId])`

  Removes a media track from a stream.

  - `track` - The `MediaStreamTrack` to remove.

  - `stream` - The `MediaStream` the track is attached to.

  - `peerId` - **(optional)** If specified, the track is removed only from the
    target peer ID (string) or list of peer IDs (array).

- ### `replaceTrack(oldTrack, newTrack, stream, [peerId])`

  Replaces a media track with a new one.

  - `oldTrack` - The `MediaStreamTrack` to remove.

  - `newTrack` - A `MediaStreamTrack` to attach.

  - `stream` - The `MediaStream` the `oldTrack` is attached to.

  - `peerId` - **(optional)** If specified, the track is replaced only for the
    target peer ID (string) or list of peer IDs (array).

- ### `onPeerJoin(callback)`

  Registers a callback function that will be called when a peer joins the room.
  If called more than once, only the latest callback registered is ever called.

  - `callback(peerId)` - Function to run whenever a peer joins, called with the
    peer's ID.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  onPeerJoin(id => console.log(`${id} joined`))
  ```

- ### `onPeerLeave(callback)`

  Registers a callback function that will be called when a peer leaves the room.
  If called more than once, only the latest callback registered is ever called.

  - `callback(peerId)` - Function to run whenever a peer leaves, called with the
    peer's ID.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  onPeerLeave(id => console.log(`${id} left`))
  ```

- ### `onPeerStream(callback)`

  Registers a callback function that will be called when a peer sends a media
  stream. If called more than once, only the latest callback registered is ever
  called.

  - `callback(stream, peerId, metadata)` - Function to run whenever a peer sends
    a media stream, called with the the peer's stream, ID, and optional metadata
    (see `addStream()` above for details).

  Example:

  ```javascript
  onPeerStream((stream, id) => console.log(`got stream from ${id}`, stream))
  ```

- ### `onPeerTrack(callback)`

  Registers a callback function that will be called when a peer sends a media
  track. If called more than once, only the latest callback registered is ever
  called.

  - `callback(track, stream, peerId, metadata)` - Function to run whenever a
    peer sends a media track, called with the the peer's track, attached stream,
    ID, and optional metadata (see `addTrack()` above for details).

  Example:

  ```javascript
  onPeerTrack((track, stream, id) => console.log(`got track from ${id}`, track))
  ```

- ### `makeAction(namespace)`

  Listen for and send custom data actions.

  - `namespace` - A string to register this action consistently among all peers.

  Returns a pair containing a function to send the action to peers and a
  function to register a listener. The sender function takes any
  JSON-serializable value (primitive or object) or binary data as its first
  argument and takes an optional second argument of a peer ID or a list of peer
  IDs to send to. By default it will broadcast the value to all peers in the
  room. If the sender function is called with binary data (`Blob`,
  `TypedArray`), it will be received on the other end as an `ArrayBuffer` of
  agnostic bytes. The sender function returns a promise that resolves when all
  target peers are finished receiving data.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  const [sendCursor, getCursor] = room.makeAction('cursormove')

  window.addEventListener('mousemove', e => sendCursor([e.clientX, e.clientY]))

  getCursor(([x, y], id) => {
    const peerCursor = cursorMap[id]
    peerCursor.style.left = x + 'px'
    peerCursor.style.top = y + 'px'
  })
  ```

- ### `ping(peerId)`

  Takes a peer ID and returns a promise that resolves to the milliseconds the
  round-trip to that peer took. Use this for measuring latency.

  - `peerId` - Peer ID string of the target peer.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  // log round-trip time every 2 seconds
  room.onPeerJoin(id =>
    setInterval(async () => console.log(`took ${await room.ping(id)}ms`), 2000)
  )
  ```

### `selfId`

A unique ID string other peers will know the local user as globally across
rooms.

### `getOccupants(config, namespace)`

**(üî• Firebase only)** Returns a promise that resolves to a list of user IDs
present in the given namespace. This is useful for checking how many users are
in a room without joining it.

- `config` - A configuration object
- `namespace` - A namespace string that you'd pass to `joinRoom()`.

Example:

```javascript
console.log((await trystero.getOccupants(config, 'the_scope')).length)
// => 3
```

## Strategy comparison

**Loose, (overly) simple advice for choosing a strategy:** Use the BitTorrent or
IPFS strategy for experiments or when your heart yearns for fuller
decentralization, use Firebase for "production" apps where you need full control
and reliability. IPFS is itself in alpha so the Trystero IPFS strategy should be
considered experimental.

Trystero makes it trivial to switch between strategies ‚Äì just change a single
import line:

```javascript
import {joinRoom} from 'trystero/[torrent|firebase|ipfs]'
```

|                   | setup¬π  | reliability¬≤ | time to connect¬≥ | bundle size‚Å¥ | occupancy polling‚Åµ |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| üåä **BitTorrent** | none ‚úÖ | variable     | better           | ~24K ‚úÖ      | none               |
| üî• **Firebase**   | ~5 mins | reliable ‚úÖ  | best ‚úÖ          | ~173K        | yes ‚úÖ             |
| ü™ê **IPFS**       | none ‚úÖ | variable     | good             | ~1.63M üëÄ    | none               |

**¬π** Firebase requires an account and project which take a few minutes to set
up.

**¬≤** Firebase has a 99.95% SLA. The BitTorrent strategy uses public trackers
which may go down/misbehave at their own whim. Trystero has a built-in
redundancy approach that connects to multiple trackers simultaneously to avoid
issues. IPFS relies on public gateways which are also prone to downtime.

**¬≥** Relative speed of peers connecting to each other when joining a room.
Firebase is near-instantaneous while the other strategies are a bit slower.

**‚Å¥** Calculated via Rollup bundling + Terser compression.

**‚Åµ** The Firebase strategy supports calling `getOccupants()` on a room to see
which/how many users are currently present without joining the room.

## Firebase setup

If you want to use the Firebase strategy and don't have an existing project:

1. Create a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project
1. Create a new Realtime Database
1. Copy the database ID and use it as the `appId` in your Trystero
   config
1. [*Optional*] Configure the database with security rules to limit activity:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": false,
    ".write": false,
    "__trystero__": {
      ".read": false,
      ".write": false,
      "$room_id": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These rules ensure room peer presence is only readable if the room namespace is
known ahead of time.
